## Introduction

Welcome to the Built By Cactus React code test. React is used heavily within Build By Cactus, on everything from custom Gutenberg blocks to completely headless WordPress websites. As such, it's important for us to know how well developers understand the framework and how to work with it.



## The Repository

Within this repository is a React application developed with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). The application is a simple todo application that requires finishing, so that you may add, complete and un-complete items from the list. It also requires tests to be written using the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro), which you may run using `npm run test`.

You should work in feature branches following the [Git Flow](https://builtbycactus.github.io/docs/git/setup) methodology. When you've completed your feature, open a [pull request](https://builtbycactus.github.io/docs/git/pull-requests) and add the tag `Ready for review`. This will let us know that you're ready for us to review the codebase.

Your commits should be granular and should show how you approach the problem. We're just as interested in your approach and methodology as we are in you submitting perfect code. Please make sure there are no linting errors. You may run the linter using `npm run lint`.

These tasks should take you no longer than a few hours to complete.



## The Tasks

**To complete this test, you must fix the following issues:**

- [ ] Make sure you can Create, Complete and Un-complete tasks within the application.
- [ ] Add automated tests to confirm that the above are working.

**Bonus tasks**

- [ ] Get the task list persisting across page reloads.
- [ ] Add automated testing for task list persistence.

<small>**N.B.** Test coverage must be greater than 90%</small>



## Running the code

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run test:coverage`

Launches the test runner in the coverage mode.<br />
See the section about [coverage reporting](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/#coverage-reporting) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

Launches the linter on project files.
